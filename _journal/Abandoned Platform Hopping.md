# Abandoned Platform Hopping

Imagine you and the homies just posted up on one of these for a few weeks. Hopping from rig to rig avoid the Coast Fags or whoever thinks you can't be there. Zipping from platform to platform on a jetski or speedboat and docking it

In what world would you  not be able to live inside one of these for 3 weeks just because. Just because, you may have committed financial crimes and gotten caught. Just because you are doing something that you "shouldn't be" or that certain groups or organizations "don't approve of." I've been in my current one for a month and have only had two close encounters.

This one could even accommodate 4 different groups at a time. How quaint! Think of the possibilities when you see the world as a Videogame map instead of your neighborhood, workplace, your friend's apartments, your favorite bar, and your hometown.
